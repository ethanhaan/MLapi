Learn More\nResMed Inc (ASX: RMD) shares have been on a strong run this month.\nSince the start of January, the sleep treatment company's shares have risen 10.5%.\nA good portion of this gain came last week after ResMed impressed the market with its second quarter update.\nThe good news for investors is that the team at Goldman Sachs believes the company's shares can still rise materially from current levels.\nAccording to a note, the broker has responded to ResMed's quarterly update by reiterating its buy rating and lifting its price target to $33.50.\nBased on the current ResMed share price of $28.45, this implies potential upside of 18% for investors over the next 12 months.\nCommenting on the quarter, Goldman said:\nRMD reported solid +4-6% earnings beats at 2Q24 as US device growth recovered back to/above market growth, whilst the pace of gross margin recovery exceeded our expectations.\nGoldman also addressed concerns over gross margins, competitive dynamics, and the impact of GLP-1s such as Ozempic. It said:\nTaking a higher-level view beyond the quarter, the three primary debates that have dominated investor focus over the last 12+ months have been: 1) the potential impact of further GLP-1 adoption on CPAP demand/adherence; 2) the shape of GM recovery, and if/when RMD can return to pre-Covid profitability; and 3) competitive dynamics amongst incumbents, particularly the magnitude of impact if/when PHIA re-enters the US CPAP markets. On all three points we believe there is sufficient positivity to continue to see asymmetric upside risk at current valuations and, overall, we saw nothing today to change our fundamental views.\nOverall, the broker sees ResMed as a top option for investors right now despite its strong gains this month.\n\n\nWhen investing expert Scott Phillips has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the flagship Motley Fool Share Advisor newsletter he has run for over ten years has provided thousands of paying members with stock picks that have doubled, tripled or even more.* \nScott just revealed what he believes could be the 'five best ASX stocks' for investors to buy right now.

For more info SHARE ANALYSIS: RMD\nResMed\u2019s December quarter showed long-awaited margin improvement and relieved market fears of the impact of weight-loss drugs.\n-ResMed\u2019s\u00a0Q2 result receives applause-Gross margin expansion the highlight-Efficiencies should lead to further improvement-Weight loss drugs may actually help, not hinder\nBy Greg Peel\nIn August last year, global pharma companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly each rallied over 15% after data from a cardiovascular study suggested that GPL-1 weight-loss drugs not only reduced weight, but also lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease in obese patients.\nGiven the connection between obesity and sleep apnoea, the market assumed the rise of GLP-1s would lead to a fall in demand for ResMed\u2019s ((RMD)) devices. The stocks subsequently lost over -25% of its value in a month.\nThe stock has since been quietly making a comeback as market panic subsided, and on a positive response to the company\u2019s December quarter earnings result released last Thursday, ResMed has all but recouped those losses.\n\nAt the Margin\nAnalysts have long been waiting to see improvement in ResMed\u2019s gross margin, which took a hit as a fallout from covid. As it was, the gross margin rose 90 basis points in the December quarter from the previous quarter to 57%, exceeding analyst forecast by 60-80 points or so depending on their forecasts.\nWhile ResMed\u2019s device sales grew 11% in the quarter (constant currency), and mask sales 9%, it was margin expansion that had analysts cheering.\nThere were three clear drivers of the expansion.\nFirstly, ResMed implemented low to mid single-digit price increases last October, which showed up in the December quarter but will progressively benefit in the next few quarters, analysts suggest, as customers roll off their current contracts.\nReduced freight costs were a big contributor to margin expansion as ResMed transitioned to sea freight from air freight during covid disruptions. While there could be further freight savings ahead, management is cautious given sea freight costs have recently increased due to the Red Sea conflict and \u201clong way round\u201d diversions.\nIf there is an impact, it will not impact the current quarter.\nFinally, manufacturing efficiencies made a contribution. The availability of the newer AirSense 11 mask is increasing, which will allow ResMed to phase out the AirSense 10. Analysts note the shift to one manufacturing line should improve efficiency of the production process and provide an opportunity for manufacturing optimisation.\nFurthermore, ResMed reduced its selling, general & administrative expenses in the quarter and its R&D expenses, largely as a result of reducing its global workforce by -5%, mostly in non-SG&A activities. The company is instead planning to invest more in product innovation and increased brand awareness.\nOrd Minnett, for one, believes this is a sound strategy to help further penetrate the market.\nOverblown Threat\nWhen ResMed\u2019s share price initially collapsed on the emergence of GLP-1s, analysts were quick to call the response overblown. One reason is the drugs are expensive, and not a once-only cure. Rather, weight will return if one stops taking them.\nFast-forward to now and there is more reason to believe the impact will be minimal. In fact, the drugs may even work in ResMed\u2019s favour simply by increasing awareness of sleep apnoea among the obese.\nUBS points to recent data showing patients with a GLP-1 script and an OSA (obstructive sleep apnoea) diagnosis are more likely to begin CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy than those with just the OSA diagnosis. This has attracted investor attention and the company plans to present more analyses later, although clinical trials are not planned.\nHowever, Eli Lilly has been conducting its SURMOUNT-OSA trial to assess the weight-loss effectiveness of its drug. Results are expected in April. Importantly, the trial is broken into two groups of patients \u2013 those using CPAP now and those not.\nResMed emphasised at its conference call that a combination of GLP-1 and CPAP is expected to emerge as the best solution. Data have\u00a0highlighted that patients on GLP-1s are more likely to initiate CPAP therapy, which would lead to higher rates of adherence and resupply, Macquarie notes.\nThe bottom line is a combination of GLP-1 and CPAP therapy is expected to bring better results than substitution of CPAP with GLP-1.\nManagement also noted that even when assuming the drugs will reduce sleep apnoea by -15%, there will still be over one billion people in the global addressable market by 2050.\nCompetition\nAlso hanging over ResMed\u2019s outlook for some time now has been the anticipated return to market of Philip\u2019s competing mask. Yet as time has gone on, that timeline seems to always move out further.\nIn the meantime, ResMed has improved market share. This is unlikely to be eroded by the return of Philips, most analysts believe, and at this stage the US FDA has requested supplementary testing on the recalled CPAP machines.\nWhat\u2019s more, ResMed has received regulatory and reimbursement approval for a new mask offering, with a market launch expected \u201csoon\u201d.\nCiti nevertheless plays a cautious line, forecasting a rebasing of the CPAP device market over several years combined with Philips gradually regaining around 20% market share, stealing some 10% from ResMed.\nBroker Views\nResMed\u2019s result has seen brokers rush to upgrade their earnings forecasts, with increased revenues and margin expansion expected to continue.\nThere are six brokers monitored daily by FNArena covering the stock. Five already held Buy or equivalent ratings, although two are yet to update. UBS is the loner with a Neutral rating. The consensus price target has increased to $33.04 from $32.23.\n(Note: UBS quotes a target in US dollars, and is thus not included in the consensus measure.)\nAmong brokers not monitored daily, Jarden has increased its target to $31.2 from $30.13 and retains Overweight.\nWilsons has increased its valuation by 4%, and set a target of $31.29 (last $30.00 in November). Wilsons retains Overweight.\nGoldman Sachs has upgraded its forecasts and retains Buy, alongside a target of $33.50.\nElsewhere, RBC Capital has raised its price target by one dollar to US$182 while rating the US-listed shares as Sector Perform.\nFind out why FNArena subscribers like the service so much: \"Your Feedback (Thank You)\" \u2013 Warning this story contains unashamedly positive feedback on the service provided.\nFNArena\u00a0is proud about its track record and past achievements: Ten Years On\n\nClick to view our Glossary of Financial Terms\nFor more info SHARE ANALYSIS: RMD - RESMED INC\n\n\n\n1:29 PM - Australia\n10:45 AM - Daily Market Reports\n10:00 AM - Weekly Reports\n8:57 AM - Daily Market Reports\n8:15 AM - Daily Market Reports\n\nJan 15 2024 - Rudi's View\nJan 23 2024 - Technicals\nJan 16 2024 - Weekly Reports\nJan 22 2024 - PR NewsWire\nJan 10 2024 - Weekly Reports\nJan 11 2024 - Book Reviews\n\u00a9 FNArena 2024.

It is currently the Australia\u2019s largest company in terms of revenue and market share.\nWoolworths\u2019 main operations include supermarkets (under the Woolworths brand in Australia and Countdown in New Zealand), retailing through its discount department stores under the Big W brand, and business-to-business (B2B) brands like PFD. Overwhelmingly, it\u2019s 35%+ share of Australian supermarkets is its crown jewel. \nWoolworths is a very popular choice for many ASX investors seeking dividend income. It consistently pays a fully franked dividend, usually at a yield of over 3%, and offers a very defensive earnings stream. It\u2019s competitive advantage is probably best summarised as scale (distribution, low costs, etc.) and proximity (most shoppers still shop based on distance to the supermarket). \nSince we consider Woolworths Group Ltd to be a blue chip stock, or a mature business, we like to look at things like return on invested capital (ROIC) and revenue growth as signs of sustainability. In FY23, Woolworths Group Ltd had an ROIC of 13.20% and revenue has compounded at 6.6% in recent years. Anything over 10% ROIC is pretty strong for a mature-style business, since its cost of capital is likely below that level, so Woolworths Group Ltd crosses this hurdle.\n\nResmed was founded in 1989 by Peter Farrell in Australia but is now based in San Diego, California. It is a medical equipment company that provides cloud-connectable continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If Resmed\u2019s name or financial reports look different it\u2019s because Resmed\u2019s ASX shares are CDIs and its primary listing is the NYSE.\nResmed operates on a global scale, with 10,000+ employees and a presence in over 140 countries. It has two primary business units: Sleep and Respiratory Care, and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Sleep and Respiratory Care, ResMed provides industry-leading CPAP machines for sleep apnea. Other devices are often marketed in this space but CPAP is the most effective therapy for all severities of OSA. The Respiratory Care unit covers patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP systems at night to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support. Within the SaaS unit Resmed providers that assists durable or home medical equipment (DME/HME). Basically, it assists in out-of-hospital care. \nDue to Resmed\u2019s large digital health network powered by its cloud-connected devices, Resmed can leverage its industry-leading hardware (e.g. masks and humidifiers) and its SaaS data to drive insights, improve outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.\nOne way to have a \u2018speedy read\u2019 of where the WOW share price is, is to study something like dividend yield thru time. Remember, the dividend yield is effectively the \u2018cash flow\u2019 to a share holder, but it can be influenced by yearly or bi-yearly fluctuations. Currently, Woolworths Group Ltd shares have a dividend yield of around 2.87%, which compares to its 5-year average of 2.66%. Put simply, WOW shares are trading below their historical average dividend yield.\nThe RMD share price trades at a price-sales ratio of 4.42x, which compares to its 5-year long-term average of 7.81x. So, RMD shares are trading below their historical average. However, please do more investigating than a simple multiple like this.

                "ResMed\u2019s December quarter showed long-awaited margin improvement and relieved market fears of the impact of weight-loss drugs.",
                "-ResMed\u2019s\u00a0Q2 result receives applause-Gross margin expansion the highlight-Efficiencies should lead to further improvement-Weight loss drugs may actually help, not hinder",
                "By Greg Peel",
                "In August last year, global pharma companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly each rallied over 15% after data from a cardiovascular study suggested that GPL-1 weight-loss drugs not only reduced weight, but also lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease in obese patients.",
                "Given the connection between obesity and sleep apnoea, the market assumed the rise of GLP-1s would lead to a fall in demand for ResMed\u2019s ((RMD)) devices. The stocks subsequently lost over -25% of its value in a month.",
                "The stock has since been quietly making a comeback as market panic subsided, and on a positive response to the company\u2019s December quarter earnings result released last Thursday, ResMed has all but recouped those losses.",
                "",
                "At the Margin",
                "Analysts have long been waiting to see improvement in ResMed\u2019s gross margin, which took a hit as a fallout from covid. As it was, the gross margin rose 90 basis points in the December quarter from the previous quarter to 57%, exceeding analyst forecast by 60-80 points or so depending on their forecasts.",
                "While ResMed\u2019s device sales grew 11% in the quarter (constant currency), and mask sales 9%, it was margin expansion that had analysts cheering.",
                "There were three clear drivers of the expansion.",
                "Firstly, ResMed implemented low to mid single-digit price increases last October, which showed up in the December quarter but will progressively benefit in the next few quarters, analysts suggest, as customers roll off their current contracts.",
                "Reduced freight costs were a big contributor to margin expansion as ResMed transitioned to sea freight from air freight during covid disruptions. While there could be further freight savings ahead, management is cautious given sea freight costs have recently increased due to the Red Sea conflict and \u201clong way round\u201d diversions.",
                "If there is an impact, it will not impact the current quarter.",
                "Finally, manufacturing efficiencies made a contribution. The availability of the newer AirSense 11 mask is increasing, which will allow ResMed to phase out the AirSense 10. Analysts note the shift to one manufacturing line should improve efficiency of the production process and provide an opportunity for manufacturing optimisation.",
                "Furthermore, ResMed reduced its selling, general & administrative expenses in the quarter and its R&D expenses, largely as a result of reducing its global workforce by -5%, mostly in non-SG&A activities. The company is instead planning to invest more in product innovation and increased brand awareness.",
                "Ord Minnett, for one, believes this is a sound strategy to help further penetrate the market.",
                "Overblown Threat",
                "When ResMed\u2019s share price initially collapsed on the emergence of GLP-1s, analysts were quick to call the response overblown. One reason is the drugs are expensive, and not a once-only cure. Rather, weight will return if one stops taking them.",
                "Fast-forward to now and there is more reason to believe the impact will be minimal. In fact, the drugs may even work in ResMed\u2019s favour simply by increasing awareness of sleep apnoea among the obese.",
                "UBS points to recent data showing patients with a GLP-1 script and an OSA (obstructive sleep apnoea) diagnosis are more likely to begin CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy than those with just the OSA diagnosis. This has attracted investor attention and the company plans to present more analyses later, although clinical trials are not planned.",
                "However, Eli Lilly has been conducting its SURMOUNT-OSA trial to assess the weight-loss effectiveness of its drug. Results are expected in April. Importantly, the trial is broken into two groups of patients \u2013 those using CPAP now and those not.",
                "ResMed emphasised at its conference call that a combination of GLP-1 and CPAP is expected to emerge as the best solution. Data have\u00a0highlighted that patients on GLP-1s are more likely to initiate CPAP therapy, which would lead to higher rates of adherence and resupply, Macquarie notes.",
                "The bottom line is a combination of GLP-1 and CPAP therapy is expected to bring better results than substitution of CPAP with GLP-1.",
                "Management also noted that even when assuming the drugs will reduce sleep apnoea by -15%, there will still be over one billion people in the global addressable market by 2050.",
                "Competition",
                "Also hanging over ResMed\u2019s outlook for some time now has been the anticipated return to market of Philip\u2019s competing mask. Yet as time has gone on, that timeline seems to always move out further.",
                "In the meantime, ResMed has improved market share. This is unlikely to be eroded by the return of Philips, most analysts believe, and at this stage the US FDA has requested supplementary testing on the recalled CPAP machines.",
                "What\u2019s more, ResMed has received regulatory and reimbursement approval for a new mask offering, with a market launch expected \u201csoon\u201d.",
                "Citi nevertheless plays a cautious line, forecasting a rebasing of the CPAP device market over several years combined with Philips gradually regaining around 20% market share, stealing some 10% from ResMed.",
                "Broker Views",
                "ResMed\u2019s result has seen brokers rush to upgrade their earnings forecasts, with increased revenues and margin expansion expected to continue.",
                "There are six brokers monitored daily by FNArena covering the stock. Five already held Buy or equivalent ratings, although two are yet to update. UBS is the loner with a Neutral rating. The consensus price target has increased to $33.04 from $32.23.",

Some truck drivers have the iconic hourglass-shaped glass bottle tattooed on their calves. \u201cThey have Coke in their veins.\u201d\nThe original syrup was created in 1886 by pharmacist Dr John Pemberton and sold two years later to American businessman and politician Asa Griggs Candler, who founded the Coca-Cola Company in 1892. Today, Coca-Cola is sold in more than 200 markets and is the world\u2019s most-consumed soft drink.\nIn Australia, Coca-Cola and its other brands, Sprite and Fanta, command just over 40 per cent of the soft drink manufacturing market, IBISWorld data shows.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re in a category, we want to be number one or number two.\u201d\nWhile local production began in Sydney\u2019s Waterloo 85 years ago, the current iteration of the Australian business is only 2.5 years young; Coca-Cola Amatil delisted from the ASX in May 2021 after being purchased by the European arm for $9.9 billion. The acquisition has allowed the business today, called Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), to double down on its key brands without being side-tracked by non-core businesses, such as fruit processor SPC.\nThe Australian bottling operation\u2019s revenue came in at nearly $6 billion in 2022, a 75 per cent jump on $3.4 billion the previous year.\nCoke Zero consumption is catching up to Coke Classic.Credit: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg\n\u201cFor the last 85 years the brand on the door is what we anchor to,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cPeople often say, \u2018doesn\u2019t it sell itself?\u2019 [It\u2019s about] continuing to find those pockets where you can grow.\u201d\nOne of those pockets is the soft drink giant\u2019s sugar-free options. The manufacturer has been pivoting away from sugar for years: about 45 per cent of its drinks sold in 2022 were low- or zero-calorie. Coke Zero and Coke Classic are neck-and-neck.\n\u201cIf you live around here [in North Sydney], it\u2019s probably 60 per cent Zero Sugar, 40 per cent Classic. If you\u2019re in Penrith at the Leagues Club, it\u2019s the inverse,\u201d said Rodriguez.\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re an absolute fanatical Coke drinker, the taste is becoming really, really close.\u201d\nEnergy drink Monster has been earmarked as their second-largest growth driver. The focus is to wrest market share away from its closest rival, V, by aligning with high-octane sports players, from motorbikes and surfing to UFC and AFL and e-sports gamers.\n \u201cMonster is associated with that. You won\u2019t see them advertise on TV, but they\u2019re really youth-prevalent gaming sports so they\u2019re doing really, really well.\u201d \nMeanwhile, sports drink Powerade commands 50 per cent of its market and is riding the long-term growth trend of fitness and performance, while its water brand Mount Franklin is growing through citrus-flavoured sparkling water. CCEP has a presence in the coffee market through Grinders, sold primarily in supermarkets, and until recently, grab-and-go iced coffee Barista Bros, which was discontinued in July this year.\n\u201cWe thought it was a really strong offering, but it didn\u2019t appeal broadly enough,\u201d Rodriguez said. Australians tend to prefer fresh milk, while Barista Bros was made from long-life or UHT milk. \u201cAfter eight, nine years, we were still number four and number five player. And when we\u2019re in a category, we want to be number one or number two.\u201d\nKeeping the company\u2019s brands front of mind for consumers is crucial.

Suntory Beam\u2019s alcohol brands, which Coca-Cola has been operating under a 16-year contract, is due to end in mid-2025, meaning CCEP will lose the likes of Jim Beam, Canadian Club and Midori from its portfolio.\n\u201cWhat we do know is that we will participate in the alcohol category,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting part of our future growth, but it\u2019s a path we\u2019ve got to navigate through.\u201d \nThe hardest part of the job, according to Rodriguez, is keeping the team focused on growing brands that already lead the world.\n\u201cWe have the best read in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a review of every channel, whether you\u2019re at an airport, whether you\u2019re buying from vending machines, whether you\u2019re in a [quick-service restaurant] like McDonald\u2019s, a cafe like this, or in your local supermarket.
